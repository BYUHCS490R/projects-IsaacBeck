        <p>Root is the root folder, and where the website starts. Folders have names, and those names are a part of the file path of the folders to where the file is, which ends with the file name.</p>
        <p>A default document is a flie named index.html. It is in the root folder, and acts as a home page.</p>
        <p>Absolute links are links of the entire URL file path of the webpage including the domain, and relative links are only to the file using the path. You would use relative links to not have to change a bunch of individual links when you need to change them.</p>
        <a href="structuralTags.html">Link</a>
        <p>The three rules with relative links are going inside a folder, going up and down a folder, and starting over.</p>

        <p>Links do not always need to be inside a NAV tag.</p>
