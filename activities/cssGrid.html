            <p>The parent-child relationship in HTML is that a parent is an element that can have other elements in it, which are called
                 children. It becomes essential when using flex and grid because it determines the positioning and layout of the elements.</p>
            <p>The two main differences between CSS Grid and CSS Flex is that grid is 2 dimensional with columns
                 and rows, and flex is 1 dimensional with columns or rows. Grid has the parent tell the child their size.
                  Flex is the opposite with the child determine its own size and then layout of the children in its box.</p>
