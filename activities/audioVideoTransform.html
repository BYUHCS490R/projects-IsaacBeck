        <p>The positives and negatives of hosting your videos on YouTube are that you can share it with embedded links. A positive is it's free. A negative is that at the end of the video Youtube shows other videos or ads.</p>
        <p>The most useful thing you can do with a transform is it allows you to rotate elements on your page, and animate.</p>
        <p>The schedule for the rest of the class is on Wednesday we are learning about bootstrap. Next Monday and Wednesday we are taking a practice Final Exam. The Final Project is due next Wednesday. During our final exam period we are presenting. </p>
