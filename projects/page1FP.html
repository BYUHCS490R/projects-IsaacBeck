            <p>Hot Pot is a Chinese dish where people cook raw ingredients like meat, vegetables,
                 tofu, and noodles in a pot of broth placed in the middle of the table. 
                 People eat it together, and they can each cook the ingredients however 
                 they prefer them. I like to eat it because it is interactive and fun to eat,
                  while also tasting very good.</p>
            <p>You make hot pot by first making a flavored broth, and then adding different ingredients
                 and seasonings to get the taste that you want. It is then kept heated at the
                  center of the table, for everyone to use to cook their food to the level they
                   want it, in a personalized customized way.</p>
