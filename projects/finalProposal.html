        <p>Title: Food in Asia</p>
        <p>Topic: Asian Food</p>
        <p>Paragraph: I choose this topic because I have lived in China for seven years, and have eaten and really liked a lot of different types of Asian food
            from many different countries. I want to make people more aware of popular food that they might not have had before and could like if they tried it.
            This website will help people know more about food from Asian countries.</p>
        <p>Home page: The home page will be an overview of food in Asian countries and what they are like, and what food each page is about.</p>
        <p>5 Pages, each one about a specific food:</p>
        <p>1. Hot Pot (China)</p>
        <p>2. Sushi (Japan)</p>
        <p>3. Bibimbap (South Korea)</p>
        <p>4. Pho (Vietnam)</p>
        <p>5. Chicken Tikka Masala (India)</p>
        <p>The form content will be: name, email, phone number, food item (selected from a dropdown), quantity, address, and a comment field.</p>
        <p>The table fields will be: Food, Country, Ingredients, Price, Spiciness Level</p>
        <p>Paragraph about collecting content: I will collect information for the content of my site through using my own knowledge of having eaten these foods, 
            and through online sources. I will get images to use through the creative common license.</p>
