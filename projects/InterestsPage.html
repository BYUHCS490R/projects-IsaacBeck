        <h2>Interests</h2>
        <p>I like sports because I like physical activities. The sports that I like are basketball, 
            soccer, and ping-pong. I played on the basketball team when I was in highschool and it was pretty fun.</p>
        <p>I like these sports because of the positions I played and being on a team with others. On my basketball team I played center. In soccer I played the forward position.</p>
