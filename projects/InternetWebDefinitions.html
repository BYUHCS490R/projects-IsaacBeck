        encoding English characters to unique numbers, allowing computers to communicate with each other.</p>
    <p>Unicode is similar to ASCII, but is a universally standardized system that encodes 
        a unique numerical value to every characater in many languages around the world.</p>

    <h2>What is UTF-8?</h2>
    <p>UTF-8 is a transformation format to take Unicode and represent it in a computer readable format, 
        using 8-bit bytes. It is the standard used on the web, allowing internalization, making text be
         shown correctly in many different languages.</p>

    <h2>URL</h2>
